                <h3>May 12 2019</h3>
                <p>Today we started development of the Android app. We had planned to develop an Electron app which
                    would
                    be cross platform and allow for us to write the code once and use it on every platform. This
                    includes a website, Android, IOS, MacOS, Windows and Linux. Unfortunately JavaScript, which is the 
                    backend of the Electron framework, is unsuitable for the platform we are creating and to
                    both of us had limited experience in JavaScript. So, we decided to move away from
                    JavaScript for now and work on development of the Android app. We both have Android phones and it will require
                    the least reworking of our code to get an MVP (Minimal Viable Product)
                    fairly quickly. So now we are taking our Java code and working to implement it in an Android App.

                <h3>May 4 2019</h3>
                <p>Happy Star Wars day everyone. Today we started building the app in the Electron framework. This will
                    require an entire rewrite of the code into JavaScript, but that is better than the alternative which
                    is attempting to build a modern app in JavaFX. By doing this in Electron, we can take our knowledge 
                    of HTML and CSS and apply it toward creating a beautiful UI. The overarching
                    framework that we are using has a very well supported JavaScript implementation so it should work in JavaScript.</p>

                <h3>May 1 2019</h3>
                <p>After three months of development we have hit a major milestone. We just ran a test where we sent
                    messages encrypted with AES256 and RSA4096 directly to one another across campus without a
                    centralized server. This means that unlike other messaging services the message did not pass through
                    a server on its way to its destination. Any message sent over Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts etc.
                    is sent through the site's serverâ€™s before it is sent to the client. We send messages
                    directly to the other person that you care chatting with. this cuts out a lot of middle men 
                    and creates a foundation for internet free messaging.</p>
